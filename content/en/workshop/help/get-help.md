- There is a dedicated [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/v66uAhBEBw) for this workshop, which you can join to ask questions
  if anything is unclear or if you get stuck at any point!<br> I also welcome any suggestions that may improve this workshop there.
- Please don't bloat the server with off-topic questions (e.g. General OpenFOAM or CFD questions). If you have
  such questions, [cfd-online forums](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/) and
  the [OpenFOAM Discord Server](https://discord.gg/P9p9eHn) are the right places to go to.

- It's possible to request certificates of attendance by dropping a mail to `{{< email user="holger-marschall" domain="tu-darmstadt.de" >}}`
