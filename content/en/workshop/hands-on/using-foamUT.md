- We'll be using the unit-testing framework as a black-box to verify the correctness of your code in hands-on sessions.
  - You only need to change one file per activity; Mostly
- Exercises are provided as test units for convenient interaction with the code (compile-run-debug cycles).
- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/FoamScience/foamUT) and run [`Alltest`](https://github.com/FoamScience/foamUT/blob/master/Alltest) using your local OpenFOAM installation to make sure everything works as expected.

The following diagram depicts the general workflow of solving the exercises proposed during the hands-on sessions:

In short, the `Alltest` script runs all unit tests found in [`tests`](https://github.com/FoamScience/foamUT/tree/master/tests) directory on all OpenFOAM cases found in [`cases`](https://github.com/FoamScience/foamUT/tree/master/cases) directory. So, to run your own tests:

```bash
# Clone the repos
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/FoamScience/foamUT foamUT
git clone <Exercise-repo-URL> Ex01
# Replace sample tests with the exercise code
cd foamUT
rm -rf tests/exampleTests
ln -s $PWD/../Ex01/exercises tests/ex01
# Compile and run tests
./Alltest
```

{{< details  "Important notes about using foamUT" >}}
- If you want to see FATAL ERRORS (As if running a regular solver), put `Foam::FatalError.dontThrowExceptions();` at the start of the test case.
- Your code is supposed to work (all tests pass) both in serial and in parallel.
- The unit tests are timed-out in `Alltest` (change [`timeOut`](https://github.com/FoamScience/foamUT/blob/4b9da1eba5713c7e74e5b553a79614ed7e1c7d91/Alltest#L30) if it's too quick for you).
- The unit tests run in `/dev/shm` by default; you can change this in [`Alltest`](https://github.com/FoamScience/foamUT/blob/4b9da1eba5713c7e74e5b553a79614ed7e1c7d91/Alltest#L28)
- All cases run on 4 processors but tests may run on specific processors only.
{{< /details >}}

If your machine has less than 4 CPUs, you need to enable MPI oversubscribing; otherwise your parallel tests will fail
(This is useful for example if you're using Github codespaces or running CI jobs on Github machines which only have 2 CPUs):
```bash
sed -i 's/mpirun/mpirun --oversubscribe/g' Alltest
```

Head out to [the wiki page](https://github.com/FoamScience/foamUT/wiki) if you're interested in the Unit-testing framework.

At this point, only one task remains:

0. [x] Register to the [Workshop's event]() and [login](/login) here with your Github account.
1. [x] Set up a Text Editor or an IDE for OpenFOAM development.
2. [x] Have a working OpenFOAM installation.
2. [x] Clone our unit-testing framework and make sure it works for you.
3. [ ] Solve a demo exercise so you get familiarized with the typical workflow during the hands-on sessions (You'll need no knowledge from the workshop for this).
