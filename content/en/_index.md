title : "Workshop: Parallelization in OpenFOAM for HPC Deployment"
description: "Participants will be introduced to the different concepts of parallelization, focusing on MPI communications, along with code examples for illustration. Moreover, we will provide hands-on exercises to further deepen and solidify the transferred knowledge. The participants will further gain an overview over the distinct techniques and dedicated tools involved to run a massively parallel computation using OpenFOAM, as well as over ongoing HPC-related activities in research and development."
lead: "A short community workshop for parallel MPI communications in OpenFOAM - Take control of your learning journey with a self-paced, hands-on workshop!"
